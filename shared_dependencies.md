Shared Dependencies:

1. Scrapy: All the files in the project are dependent on the Scrapy library for Python. This library provides all the necessary tools and functions for web scraping.

2. GeekbarItem: This is a data schema defined in "items.py" that represents the product data to be scraped. It is used in "geekbar_spider.py" to store the scraped data.

3. Settings: The "settings.py" file contains settings for the Scrapy spider. These settings are used across the project, including in "middlewares.py", "pipelines.py", and "geekbar_spider.py".

4. Middlewares: The "middlewares.py" file contains middleware classes for handling requests and responses. These are used in "settings.py" and "geekbar_spider.py".

5. Pipelines: The "pipelines.py" file contains pipeline classes for processing scraped items. These are used in "settings.py" and "geekbar_spider.py".

6. DOM Element IDs: The "geekbar_spider.py" file uses specific DOM element IDs to locate the data on the webpage. These IDs include those for product names, coil, puff count, battery specs, and product photos.

7. JSON: The scraped data is stored in a structured JSON format. This format is used in "pipelines.py" and "geekbar_spider.py".

8. Pagination: The "geekbar_spider.py" file handles pagination on the website. This involves shared function names and variables related to page numbers and URLs.

9. Dynamic Content: The "geekbar_spider.py" file also handles dynamic content on the website. This involves shared function names and variables related to AJAX requests and responses.
